This project demonstrates basic web scraping techniques in Python, including:

- Downloading a webpage.
- Extracting hyperlinks.
- Extracting image URLs.
- Scraping data from HTML tables.

# 2. Reading and Writing CSV Files with Python

This section shows how to read and write CSV files using Python's `csv` module.

# 3. DataFrame

This section covers key pandas DataFrame operations, including:

- Creating an Empty DataFrame** and populating it using a list of dictionaries, list of lists, and dictionary of lists.
- Adding New Columns and Rows**, and modifying the index values.
- Removing Duplicates**, columns, and rows using the `drop()` method.
- Accessing Data Details** with methods like `info()`, `describe()`, and `head()`.
- Renaming Columns and Index** for better organization.

These tasks provide a solid foundation for entry-level data manipulation in pandas.
